•	PUBG game, death analysis and gun prediction (https://github.com/Irekter/PUBG-Death-Analysis): R:  
o	Using Crisp-DM methodology, I cleaned and imputed the data set which contained:  
     	Killer x,y position  
     	Victim x,y position  
     	Killer Weapon used  
     	Victim weapon  
o	Derived features using Feature Engineering to add more features to the dataset like elevation and distance between the two players.  
o	Conducted preliminary EDA to identify variables with highest correlation to the weapon used.  
o	Trained kNN, Rule Learner, SVM and Random forest to identify the best model.   
o	The winner was rule-learner.  
o	Used tableau to create beautiful visualizations.
